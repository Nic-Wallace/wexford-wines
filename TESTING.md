## Lighthouse Audit
I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

### Known Issues


| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| With a known order-number, users can brute-force "checkout_success.html" and see potentially sensitive information. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/order-history.png) |
| If a product is in your bag/cart, but then gets deleted from the database, it throws errors from the session storage memory. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/session-storage.png) |


> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
